### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, I especially think the lecture on event listeners and advanced javascript was useful because there was a lot of javascript functionality that we had to implement. Some of which I had not previously been familiar with.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have completely implemented the stretch features. I think the way that I handled data made things harder than it should've been so I would've completely redesigned by data storage as well. I also wish I got more time to work on design, but I was focused on functionality over looks.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I really liked the design of some of my peers. I think that everyone had their own special style or flair that they added to their projects and I really enjoyed seeing their personality shine through during their presentations. I actually saw a way to implement one of the features from another peer and decided to change my implementation to follow what they did.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.
Shoutout to Jesus he helped me a lot to debug and whiteboard many different issues.
